Hi, I'm MD Rakibul Hasan, a full stack web developer with over 4 years of experience. I have a passion for building elegant and intuitive web applications that provide a great user experience. My key strengths are in JavaScript, React, Node, TypeScript, and Nest.js.

I believe that great software comes from a combination of smart engineering and beautiful design, and I strive to achieve both in all of my projects. I love solving complex problems and finding innovative solutions that improve the overall quality of the software I build.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have a strong interest in DevOps and system design. I enjoy exploring new tools and technologies to improve the deployment and scalability of web applications.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, playing guitar, or exploring new hiking trails.

If you're interested in working together, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm always eager to collaborate with other developers and entrepreneurs to build amazing products.
