I am **Rakibul Hasan** from  Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am a full stack developer. I have been developing various frontend applications using **React**, **Redux**, etc many packages and tools for more than 3 years. I have been also developing backend applications using **Node.js,** **Nest.js**.

I am very interested and passionate on **DevOps** and **System Design & Architecture**. I usually spend my free times learning and exploring many topics on DevOps, System Design & Architecture, Design Patterns, System Scalability and many other modern technologies, tools, frameworks and languages.

I am mostly skilled and experienced in building **clean, maintainable & scale-able Frontend applications** using React, Typescript, REST/GraphQL. I love using and building custom hooks, reusable components, component documentation with storybook. Some of my favorite and mostly used packages are react-hook-form, react-query, constate, redux, redux-toolkit, axios, etc.

I have also developed few **Ecommerce**, **SaaS**, **Service Based** backend applications using Nest.js. I have used **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Couchbase** in my projects. I have built both **REST** and **GraphQL** backends. I have experience working in **microservice architecture** using **Nest.js**, **gRPC**.

I've also worked with various **AWS** services like **EC2, ECS, ECR, S3, Route53, Amplify, Lightsail**, etc.

I love to play and work with various modern tools and technologies like **Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins**, etc.

My future dream is to be a **System Design Architect**. I'm always interested and excited about latest and modern technologies.
